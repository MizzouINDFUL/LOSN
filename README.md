# Linear Order Statistic Neuron (LOSN)<br>

## Code Overview

This code is broken down into the following files:

1. **config.py** - Configuration File
2. **experiment.py** - Main File. Includes Training
3. **datasets.py** - Loads Dataset: XOR || Synthethic 
4. **plots.py** - Displays Training Loss, Results

This code supports the following functionality:

1. Train LOSN to learn aggregation
2.  Train LOSN to solve XOR problem
